teaser: indexicons/you.jpg
description: Youth and Organizations United. YOU. This project is a joint effort between Iowa State University and California State University Chico's psychology department to develop solutions to issues that effect the current homeless population, including human trafficking. From this base, I was able to take a unified advocacy system for human trafficking survivors and extend it to a nationwide system.
